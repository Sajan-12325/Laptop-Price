This project is done is simultaneous with Correlation and Visuaization repository where we predict automobile prices data exploration, visualization, and regression modeling using Python. 


1. Load the dataset using the url and check give the column names and remove unnecessary columns

2. Check the data types and fix the data types, check for null values and fix them.

3. Feature Engineering, converting categorical variables to numerical values.

4. Using various visualizations like regplots and boxplots to find relationships between variables.

5. Also checked Pearson coefficient and P-values between target variable and other variabes.

6. Using Linear regression modules and fitting the data and predicting the values for unseen data for single variable.

7. Evaluating the mode using regression metrics like mean_squared_error, r2_score or coefficient of determination

8. Plotting distribution plot to check how the well the model predicted.

9. Fitting Multiple inear regression to check whether it performs better than the previous model

10. Using Polynomial regression to check the order of polynomial features, the degree at which the model performs best.

11. Building Pipelines to automate the process of standardization, selecting the polynomial features and fitting it to the linea regression model.
